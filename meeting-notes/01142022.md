## Notes

- Administrative:
    - US-RSE Google Drive and Google Group: How do we get these? (Lance will record the steps for how to get this done)
        - Google Group - Permissions for Google drive
        - Also for calendar stuff
        - This can be added to either the "Get Involved" or "Working Group" page(s) to provide more support
        - Provide a template for Working Group pages on the Website (collab with the website team on)
    - Frequency of meeting: Start with every two weeks to get it going - then maybe scale back as time goes on.
        - Every other Friday at 2ET/1CT/12MT/11PT is good for now
        - Send out a new when2meet every 6 months or so
    - OR-WG Website (Miranda will do this)

- Goals / Scope of OR-WG
   - Raising awareness of the US-RSE itself
      - What does this look like?
          - Yearly workshop/conference (Organizational structure - but every year someone can volunteer to chair it / take on the heavy load) - a good, concrete task
              - GOAL: We had a virtual one last year. We should keep doing that - had a good turnout! (Similar to what other RSE associations do)
                  - This is especially good for new people.
                  - Ideally, we'd like to do more of a face-to-face element (hybrid - but probably not this year)
                  - Rotating location (try to take advantage of the different people in the association too - not just universities hosting!)
          - Collaborating with other groups/conferences (CaRCC, SciPy, Supercomputing, etc.)
          - Finding people who are RSEs currently and telling them that we exist and that they exist / have a title
              - Will help shape the conversation about "Who is an RSE?" and what that looks like
          - University partners - have a student-geared presentation that can be given to university students
          - Domain-oriented conferences that have technical tracks (outside of SC, SciPy, etc.)
              - We should poll the members to see what conferences they go to outside of the "standard" computing ones
              - If we have easy-to-use slides, ask people who already go to those conferences to pitch the US-RSE / do a quick presentation
                 - Leave room for "Fine-tune for your domain" updates
              - Might even be able to target student outreach programs within the conferences (lean on existing outreach efforts)
              - Let people see themselves in it / where they already are (how to make that epiphany happen quickly - "Oh, this is what I do.")
          - General tech conferences (PyData, PyCon, other non-python conferences)
              - There are two approaches - people who are already doing research and realize they are RSEs, or people who are in industry who want to be more like an RSE
              - We can reach more industry people at the general tech conferences
          - New People Events (new staff, new students, etc.)
              - Give a slide or two about the US-RSE (especially if there are RSEs who are there)
              - Outreach internally (no travel, using existing resources, pulling on easy strings)
   - Raising awareness of RSEs as a profession
       - What would this look like?
           - Some overlap with above already...
           - Having a generic "What is an RSE" presentation targeted at Undergrads
               - Undergrad level is probably the best "bang for our buck" scenario
               - K-12 may also just be good for benevolent outreach / getting younger kids interested in research / software engineering
               - Would it be effective to reach out to teachers / orgs at schools (affiliated with career counseling) and get involved in counseling / presenting career paths? (Miranda REALLY likes this idea)
                   - Teach teachers - give exposure to those who would give further exposure
                   - Sandra asked Gina to come as part of the DEI Speaker Series - hopefully she can give more insight into this
                   - From experience, Miranda knows that all teachers LOVE it when outside presenters come - so it's just a matter of finding people effectively
           - This may be a larger, organizational level goal - the idea of RSE + that term starting to become recognized and understood and expected to be a part of a grant application (from a funding org level!)
               - Advocacy groups in DC - talking to senators, NIH, directly interfacing with those who have sway (this may be three steps down the road, but it's good to keep it in our roadmap now)
           - Internal audiences - make sure to talk to your own organizations about RSEs and grow awareness there, too
   - We are already doing a lot of outreach programs - but they haven't been classified that way. So make sure we formalize what is already happening (like the Podcast)

- New Ideas
    - A place on the webpage to combine publications regarding the US-RSE / "how to cite US-RSE" guidelines
        - Something like this has come up with Vanessa before - [Showcase](https://github.com/USRSE/usrse.github.io/pull/627)
        - Clarification: One thing would be, "Here is how we've affected the community / how we've done outreach"
        - Clarification: Second thing would be a conglomeration of actions taken so far (mission, vision, publications, etc.)
        - Would also like to put slides - share the slides on the website!
        - Would there be any overlap with the "History of the RSE"? <- That is a blog post. We should try to broaden that reach with publications, workshops, etc. Maybe some sort of living document that gets updated that gets updated regularly.
